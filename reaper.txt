Control: click play to start; use ↑↓←→ to move

Implemented Features:
- 8 different graphical building blocks: text, grass, fire, reaper, link, destination gate, stone
- Scrolling and tilemaps with atlases: The camera moves when you go down
- AI entity: Link chases you once you get close to him. But luckily, he's not as fast as you. 
- Sprite and paperdoll animation with atlases: When you move in different directions, the character looks different. So is link! 
- Music/sfx, situational/responsive music: There is a nice bgm from pockemon, and when you touch fire or link, there's an explosive sound.
- Gamefeel: Please count this... I know the game feels kind of easy but I think it feels like a nice 2d adventure game. I really like this work!
